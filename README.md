#**📌 XamGuard**

XamGuard is a lightweight, experimental exam proctoring prototype that uses computer vision and optical flow to detect suspicious head movements and multiple people during online examinations.

This project is intended as a proof of concept, not a production-ready system.

##🚀 Features

  1. Real-time face detection using OpenCV Haar Cascades
  2. Optical flow–based head movement tracking

  3. Detection of:
     - Excessive head movement
     - Multiple people in frame
     - Face absence from camera
     - Works with a standard webcam

  4. Single-file implementation for simplicity

##🧠 How It Works
  1. Captures webcam frames
  2. Detects face(s) in each frame
  3. Tracks horizontal head movement using Farneback Optical Flow
  4. Accumulates left/right movement
  5. Flags suspicious behavior based on thresholds

##🛠️ Requirements
  1. Python 3.8+
  2. OpenCV
  3. NumPy

##⚠️ Limitations
This project has known limitations:

  1. Uses Haar cascades (less robust than modern face detectors)
  2. Optical flow noise under poor lighting
  3. Thresholds are heuristic-based
  4. No identity verification
  5. No logging or reportin

##Project Status: Early-stage / Experimental
This project is meant for:
  - Learning
  - Research
  - Community feedback
  - Feature exploration
